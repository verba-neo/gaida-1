Recent reasoning LLMs (Li et al., 2025b) such as DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-\\nAI et al., 2025) have significantly improved mathematical problem-solving through their\\nreasoning tokens encompassing long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). These models continuously\\nscrutinize their own computational processes, boosting their self-correction capability (Ku-\\nmar et al., 2024; Song et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024; YAO et al., 2024), which enhances accuracy\\nand reliability in the reasoning. This inspires us to explore the effects of incorporating minor\\nerrors into reasoning traces and evaluating how well the models can self-correct. Therefore,\\na critical question emerges: how vulnerable are these advanced reasoning LLMs to subtle\\nerrors in their input reasoning chains?\\nWe investigate this problem by examining how reasoning LLMs respond when presented\\nwith reasoning tokens containing tampered calculation results. Our findings reveal a\\nconcerning vulnerability we term \"Compromising Thought\" (CPT): when provided with\\nreasoning tokens incorporating manipulated calculation results at the ends of reasoning\\nlogic steps, models tend to undergo thinking confusion, ignore the correct reasoning steps\\nand adopt the incorrect results instead. Even when models initially demonstrate strong\\ninclination toward the correct answer during their reasoning process, the final result may\\n∗Work done during internship at UC Merced NLP Lab.\\n†Corresponding author.\\n1\\narXiv:2503.19326v2  [cs.AI]  1 Apr 2025\\nPreprint.

When the same model is presented with\\nthe same problem but with subtly tampered reasoning tokens (changing just one digit in\\nthe final product) as its previous thinking, it produces a new reasoning chain with illogical\\ncalculation steps. In addition, the final result content includes the correct steps and incorrect\\nproduct. This inconsistency demonstrates how endpoint tampering of input reasoning\\nchain can override the model’s own reasoning capabilities. This vulnerability has important\\nimplications for the reliability of reasoning LLMs. The self-correction of LLMs is crucial for\\nenhancing their reasoning robustness. However, our work shows that current reasoning\\nLLMs, despite their advances, remain susceptible to being misled by tampered tokens,\\ncompromising their self-correction abilities.\\nTo systematically study this phenomenon, we design three increasingly explicit prompting\\nmethods to encourage models to scrutinize the tampered reasoning tokens. Our experiments\\nacross multiple reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o1(Jaech et al., 2024), o3-mini1,\\nand others) reveal that these models have difficulties in identifying wrong answers in the\\nreasoning tokens, and struggle significantly to resist CPT.\\nOur investigation into CPT reveals an interesting contrast with recent work (Li et al., 2025a)\\non reasoning chains. While existing research suggests global structural alterations to long\\nCoT more significantly impact model performance than local content modifications, we find\\nthat in reasoning vulnerabilities, endpoint token manipulations can have greater effects than\\nstructural changes. Some structural modifications even enhance CPT resistance. Addition-\\nally, we discovered that when presented with tampered reasoning tokens for mathematical\\nword problems, DeepSeek-R1 may experience \"thinking stopped\"—completely ceasing its\\nreasoning process without producing a final answer. This is a security vulnerability in\\nmodel reasoning that deserves attention.\\nAbove all, the contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We focus on mathematical\\nproblem-solving and introduce a new research question: how well can reasoning LLMs\\nperform even in the presence of minor errors introduced in the input reasoning tokens? (2)\\nWe define the new concept of CPT and demonstrate, based on three approaches, that existing\\nreasoning LLMs struggle to resist CPT; (3) We find that local ending token modifications\\nhave a greater impact on model reasoning than structural changes, which is contrary to\\nthe existing research; (4) Based on our tampered reasoning tokens, we find a security\\nvulnerability that DeepSeek-R1 may stop thinking and fail to produce the final result.\\n1https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini\\n2\\nPreprint.

(2025b) discusses the evolution of different reasoning\\nLLMs and provides the comprehensive performance comparison of typical reasoning LLMs.\\n(Chen et al., 2025b) provides a summary of Long CoT, highlighting its main features, includ-\\ning deep reasoning, feasible reflection, and extensive exploration.\\nResistance of LLMs to Errors in Reasoning It is crucial to study the impact of introducing\\nminor mistakes in the reasoning process and analyze the effectiveness of the self-correction\\nof models. Mukherjee et al. (2025) focuses on improving the error identification ability of\\nLLMs in the reasoning chain. Li et al. (2025a) indicates that the structure of the long CoT is\\nvital for LLMs to learning, while small tampering to local content (for instance, the accuracy\\nof the final answer and the numerical values) do not substantially affect model performance.\\nHowever, our work reaches an opposing conclusion to some extent. In addition, many\\nstudies focus on the mathematical reasoning ability evaluation (Yuan et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\\n2024; Li et al., 2024) of LLMs. He et al. (2025) systematically studies the ability of LLMs to\\ndetect errors in long CoT reasoning, and finds that there will be calculation error, reasoning\\nerror and understanding errors in the inference of mathematical problems. But there is\\nstill relatively little research on evaluation and improvement of the model’s capability to\\nreflect and self-correct mistakes in the reasoning process (Chen et al., 2025a). Moreover, the\\nreasoning tokens may not only contain errors, but may also be inconsistent with the final\\nresults given by the reasoning LLMs (Zhou et al., 2025).\\n3\\nMethodology\\nWhen reasoning LLMs solve mathematical problems, they generate detailed reasoning\\nsteps leading to a final answer. We propose \"Compromising Thought\" (CPT) to describe a\\nvulnerability where models adopt incorrect results from tampered reasoning tokens despite\\ntheir ability to calculate correctly. This behavior raises important questions about how these\\nmodels integrate prior information with current reasoning processes.\\nTo systematically investigate CPT, we first analyze the structure of reasoning tokens in\\nmathematical problem-solving (Section 3.1), then formalize the concept of CPT and develop\\nmetrics to quantify its impact (Section 3.2). We explain our approach to tampering with\\nreasoning tokens (Section 3.3), evaluate methods to enhance model resistance (Section 3.4),\\nand investigate how structural modifications affect CPT (Section 3.5).\\n3.1\\nInitial Observations on Reasoning Token Vulnerabilities\\nWhen evaluating reasoning LLMs on mathematical problems, we discovered that models\\npresented with reasoning chains containing subtle calculation errors often adopt these\\nincorrect results in their outputs, despite their ability to calculate correctly. For example,\\nwhen DeepSeek-R1 correctly solved 38,697,082 × 4,133,991, changing just one digit in\\nthe result tokens (from 159,973,388,714,262 to 159,973,389,714,262) caused it to adopt this\\nincorrect value in subsequent reasoning.\\nThis behavior appeared across multiple models, particularly when modifications targeted\\n\"loop ending result\" tokens - the numerical conclusions at critical points in reasoning. This\\nobservation raised a key question: How do reasoning LLMs prioritize between their own\\ncalculation abilities and presented calculation results? This apparent vulnerability forms the\\nbasis of our \"Compromising Thought\" (CPT) concept formalized in the following section.\\n3.2\\nCPT of Reasoning LLMs\\nWe formalize CPT as follows: Given a mathematical problem q0, we first establish that a\\nreasoning LLM can correctly solve it, generating accurate reasoning tokens rt0 and final\\nanswer s0. We then create tampered tokens rtT by modifying specific calculation results in\\nthe ending tokens of rt0 while preserving the reasoning steps. When these tampered tokens\\n3\\nPreprint. Under review.\\nare presented alongside the original problem to the models in LM, we observe whether\\nthe model’s new reasoning tokens rtc and answer sc align with the correct answer w or are\\ninfluenced by the tampered information (Algorithm 1). It should be noted that we require\\nthe initial reasoning tokens rtm and final result sm to be correct, meaning that the evaluated\\nmodel itself has the ability to correctly solve q0. Otherwise, it is unreasonable to investigate\\nwhether it is affected by CPT.\\nTo quantify CPT susceptibility, we define the compromising rate:\\nrCPT =\\nDT\\n2DT −DCPT\\n∈[0.5, 1],\\n(1)\\nwhere DT is the number of tampered digits and DCPT is the number of digits in the model’s\\noutput matching our tampered digits rather than the correct result. For instance, with a\\nsingle-digit modification (DT = 1), a value of rCPT = 1 indicates complete compromise,\\nwhile rCPT = 0.5 shows complete resistance. Specifically, when CPT causes severe reasoning\\nconfusion in models, i.e. DT < DCPT (see the instance 5 and 6 in Appendix A), rCPT = 2.\\nThe aggregate compromising rate RCPT across n evaluation results is calculated as:\\nRCPT = 1\\nn\\nn\\n∑\\ni=1\\nrCPT,i\\n(2)\\n3.3\\nTampering with Reasoning Tokens\\nAlgorithm 1: CPT Research\\nInput: Reasoning LLM set LM, question\\nq0, method Tamper for tampering with\\nending tokens, correct answer w to q0.\\nOutput: Result s.\\ns := ∅\\n(rt0, s0) ←M(q0)\\n▷M ∈LM.\\nrtT ←Tamper(rt0)\\nqT ←q0∥rtT\\nfor j = 0 to length(LM) −1 do\\n(rtm, sm) ←LMj(q0)\\nif w ⊆sm then\\n(rtc, sc) ←LMj(qT)\\nif sc ==⊥then\\nr ←⊥\\n▷Thinking stopped.\\ncontinue\\nelse\\nr ←Compare(rtm, rtc, sm, sc)\\nend\\nelse\\nr ←⊥\\ncontinue\\nend\\ns ←s ∪r\\nend\\nreturn s\\nTo systematically study CPT, we need a principled\\napproach to create tampered reasoning tokens. As\\nillustrated in Figure 2, reasoning tokens typically\\ncontain calculation loops, self-reflection, and self-\\nverification components. Our tampering strategy\\nspecifically targets the \"loop ending result\" tokens\\n- the numerical conclusions at critical points in the\\nreasoning process.\\nWe implement digit substitution as our primary\\nmethod,\\ncarefully modifying specific digits in\\ncalculation results while maintaining the origi-\\nnal format and length.\\nFor example, changing\\n\"711,025,910,075,981\" to \"711,025,710,075,981\" by re-\\nplacing ’9’ with ’7’. The instances are shown in Ap-\\npendix C. This method creates subtle numerical dis-\\ncrepancies that challenge the model’s ability to recon-\\ncile its own calculations with presented information.\\nAfter evaluating alternative approaches, we found\\nthat digit substitution is optimal for studying CPT,\\nas methods that alter result length (insertion or dele-\\ntion) tend to trigger format validation mechanisms\\nrather than testing numerical reasoning fidelity. By\\npreserving the structure and only modifying specific\\nresult digits, we can directly assess how reasoning\\nLLMs prioritize between their own calculations and\\nexternally provided conclusions.\\n3.4\\nProbing LLM Resistance to CPT\\nTo evaluate how effectively reasoning LLMs can resist CPT, we developed three increasingly\\ndirect interventions (Figure 3):\\n• Method 1 (Uncertainty Prompting): Uses filter text suggesting possible errors in the\\nreasoning tokens.\\n4\\nPreprint.

Since reasoning tokens are often not directly accessible in API-based interactions, we\\nfocus our analysis on final outputs for this condition. These interventions create a systematic\\nframework for measuring CPT resistance across models and mathematical problem types.\\nComplete examples of model responses across these conditions are provided in Appendix B.\\nMy previous thinking is incorrect, especially the final result. \\nTherefore, I should ignore my previous reasoning and rethink.\\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\\n  model=\"deepseek-reasoner\",\\n  messages=[\\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<Question>+<Input Suffix>\"},\\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\":\"<Output Prefix>\", \"prefix\": True}])\\nprint(\"result: \", response.choices[0].message.content)\\nInput\\nSuffix\\nInput\\nSuffix\\nMethod 2\\nCode\\nOutput \\nPrefix\\nMethod 1: Uncertainty Prompting\\nMethod 2: Direct Contradiction\\nMethod 3: Output Prefix Control\\nBelow is your previous thought.

We consider self-reflection and self-verification\\ncomponents (Figure 2) as integral reasoning units. For deleted reasoning steps, we imple-\\nment two approaches: Delete-R (removing only self-reflection) and Delete-V (removing only\\nself-verification). For inserted reasoning steps, we introduce extraneous reasoning tokens\\nrelated to angle calculation between the self-reflection and self-verification components.\\nIf structural modifications have a more significant impact than content modifications on\\nreasoning outcomes, we would expect the model’s ability to resist CPT to be substantially\\nweakened when the structure is altered, leading to increased compromising thinking proba-\\nbility. Conversely, if local content modifications prove more influential, structural changes\\nmight have minimal effect or even potentially enhance CPT resistance. Through these struc-\\ntural modifications, we aim to test whether the conclusions from prior work on reasoning\\nchain structure extend to the CPT phenomenon, or whether result token modifications\\nrepresent a distinct vulnerability that operates through different mechanisms.\\n2https://api-docs.deepseek.com\\n5\\nPreprint.

Our research requires an in-depth analysis of the reasoning tokens generated\\nby reasoning LLMs. Since most model APIs do not allow direct access to these tokens,\\nautomated evaluation is difficult and extensive human assessment is required. As a result,\\nour experimental dataset is relatively concise and precise. For standalone arithmetic tasks\\n(Shrestha et al., 2025), we focus on addition and multiplication problems and construct a\\ntest dataset containing 15-digit plus 13-digit addition and 8-digit by 7-digit multiplication\\nvia random number generation. For mathematical word problems, we randomly selected 6\\nrepresentative questions (see Appendix E) from GSM-Ranges (Shrestha et al., 2025) with\\nlevel 6 perturbation to build a subset for evaluation.\\nModels. We evaluate multiple reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o3-min,\\nKimi k1.5 (long-CoT) (Team et al., 2025), Doubao (Deep Thinking) 3, and OpenAI-o1. To\\nacquire reasoning tokens, the models were accessed through their respective APIs using\\ndefault temperature settings and web-based conversations.\\nBenchmark. We conduct experimental evaluation following Algorithm 1, and use the\\nquestioning method illustrated in Figure 1 as our baseline. This baseline simply appends\\nthe question to the manipulated reasoning tokens by using a basic filter (i.e., \"Below is your\\nprevious thought.\"). We compare the baseline with three methods (Method 1-3) designed\\nto resist CPT. For mathematical calculation tasks, we adopt manipulated reasoning tokens\\nwith different levels of tampering, defined by DT ∈[1, 6]. We focus on the DT = 1 case\\nfor mathematical word problems, due to the complex numerical and logical structures of\\nthe tokens. To better demonstrate the impact of the CPT issue, we use DeepSeek-R1 for\\nM in Algorithm 1, as its generated long CoT exhibits a more rigorous and comprehensive\\nreasoning process.\\nEvaluation Protocol. For each model and problem combination, we first verify that the\\nmodel can correctly solve the problem independently. Then, following Algorithm 1, we\\npresent the model with the same problem appended with tampered reasoning tokens and\\nmeasure the compromising rate as defined in Equation 1. For structural modification\\nexperiments, we implement three variants (Delete-R, Delete-V, and Insertion) as described\\nin Section 3.5 and evaluate their impact on CPT resistance.\\n4.2\\nMain Results\\nIn Figure 4, we present the RCPT evaluation results for the reasoning LLMs performing both\\naddition and multiplication at various DT values. As far as we know, Doubao model cannot\\nimplement the output prefix method under deep-thinking, so its evaluation data for Method\\n3 are omitted and thus displayed as a zero value in Figure 5. Overall, Method 3 substantially\\noutperforms Method 1 and Method 2 in improving models’ resistance to CPT. Under the\\nbaseline condition, all models are noticeably affected by CPT, with DeepSeek-R1 being the\\nmost susceptible. For DeepSeek-R1, cases under Method 3 arise in which DT is lower than\\nDCPT, causing RCPT to exceed the baseline. This indicates that under the output prefix\\napproach, DeepSeek-R1’s mathematical computation capabilities are not robust enough.\\nFurthermore, it can be clearly observed that resistance to CPT generally strengthens as DT\\nincreases.\\n3https://www.doubao.com/chat\\n6\\nPreprint.

Finally, we reveal a security vulnerability that\\nmanipulated tokens can lead DeepSeek-R1 to stop reasoning and fail to deliver a final\\nanswer (Section 5.3).\\n5.1\\nImpact of Different Degrees of Tampering on CPT\\nIn our experiments, along with the increasing of the number of tampered digits in ending\\nreasoning tokens, the reasoning LLMs become more likely to identify and self-correct errors\\nin the calculation results. This may be related to the existing research conclusion that LLMs\\nusually fail to confidently predict the last digit of calculation tasks (Gambardella et al., 2024).\\nIn fact, the degree of numerical discrepancy caused by tampering may be the key factor.\\nAs shown below, when the modified result deviates significantly from the correct result,\\nthe models exhibit higher confidence in identifying the error in the reasoning tokens and\\nproviding the correct result.\\nSignificant tampering enhances the model’s resistance to CPT\\nWhen I add them all together, I get $1,151,679,562, but the earlier provided result was $1,151,676,562.\\nThat’s a difference of $3,000, so I’m confident there was a small error in that chain-of-thought. The\\ncorrect total cost is $1,151,679,562.\\n5.2\\nFundamental Impact of CPT on the Reasoning Process\\nBy carefully analyzing the \"compromising thinking\" process in reasoning LLMs, we find\\nthat compared with the initial reasoning tokens rtm towards solving q0, the tokens under\\nCPT are markedly fewer, and the reasoning time is noticeably shorter (even reduced by\\nmore than 60%). The reason for this is that the models have great confidence that the\\ncalculation result provided is correct, and thus perform simple verification before ending\\nthe reasoning task. For o3-mini, the reasoning and answer tokens under CPT will show\\nobvious slackness, impatience and perfunctory behavior, as shown in Figure 6. The counts\\nof tokens are calculated by Tokenizer (\"GPT-4o & GPT-4o mini\") 4. The poor performance is\\nin sharp contrast to the initial tokens, which indicate the effort to think and pursue careful\\nexamination.\\nMoreover, when dealing with mathematical word problems, o3-mini significantly outper-\\nforms DeepSeek-R1 in resisting CPT. The essence is that the reasoning time under CPT of\\nDeepSeek-R1 is less than initial reasoning time, while that of o3-mini is just the opposite\\n(see Figure 7). Under the influence of CPT, the reasonable and ideal reasoning time TCPT\\n4https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer\\n8\\nPreprint.

Therefore, TCPT should be\\nmore than Tinit. In fact, the three methods proposed in Section 3.4 all aim to make the\\nreasoning of LLMs more consistent with this principle.\\n5.3\\nThinking Stopped\\nWhen examining the impact of tampered reasoning tokens on the mathematical word\\nproblem solving of DeepSeek-R1, we accidentally observe an unsafe phenomenon: for\\ncertain questions, DeepSeek-R1 may stop thinking and fail to provide a final answer, as\\nshown in Appendix D. In this kind of reasoning tokens with thinking interruption, we can\\nstill clearly see that DeepSeek-R1 gives a relatively complete thinking process of problem\\nsolving, indicating the influence of CPT. When calling DeepSeek-R1 via its API, this thinking\\nstopped problem manifests as the value of choices[0].message.content in code being\\nempty. In our experiments, the probability of this phenomenon occurring for the chosen\\nproblems is extremely high. Further analysis reveals that the core reason for the problem is\\nthe presence of previously generated reasoning tokens for the same question in the prompt.\\nIn fact, the method to trigger this security vulnerability can be simplified as follows:\\n(rt, s) ←LMR1(q0), (rt1, s1) ←LMR1(rt),\\n(4)\\nwhere s1 has a very high probability of being empty. In other words, resubmitting to\\nDeepSeek-R1 the reasoning tokens it previously generated for q0 can cause its reasoning to\\nstop. This issue could lead to unexpected problems in downstream applications based on\\nLLMs, such as various Natural Language Processing systems exploiting LLM-based agents\\n(Zhang et al., 2024a). This discovery is of great significance for enhancing the security of\\nDeepSeek-R1 in the future.\\nThe overall structure of reasoning tokens generated by DeepSeek-R1 for mathematical word\\nproblems and standalone arithmetic tasks is similar, but this thinking stopped is difficult to\\noccur in our experiments targeting the latter. Our experimental results show that the core\\ntrigger factor has nothing to do with the count of tokens, and is more likely to be closely\\nrelated to the semantic logic within the reasoning tokens for mathematical word problem.\\nFurther investigations are needed to clarify the specific underlying logic responsible for this\\nvulnerability.\\n9\\nPreprint. Under review.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we explore the vulnerability of reasoning LLMs to subtle errors in their input\\nreasoning chains. Our findings indicate that long CoT with manipulated ending tokens can\\nmisguide reasoning LLMs to ignore the correct reasoning steps and give wrong final result.\\nFocused on mathematical problem-solving, we introduce the concept of CPT and demon-\\nstrate that existing reasoning LLMs struggle to resist CPT. In addition, our study reveals\\nthat local ending token modifications have a greater influence on model reasoning than\\nstructural changes. Finally, we discover a security vulnerability that tampered reasoning\\ntokens can cause DeepSeek-R1 to stop thinking and fail to deliver a final answer.\\nEthics Statement\\nSome of the research methods we designed may mislead LLMs into outputting incorrect\\nresults, requiring readers to have the ability to distinguish. Additionally, unsafe prompt-\\ning methods mentioned in the paper that could cause abnormal behavior of LLMs, such\\nas thinking stopped, should only be used for scientific research and authorized security\\nevaluation.\\nReferences\\nGuizhen Chen, Weiwen Xu, Hao Zhang, Hou Pong Chan, Chaoqun Liu, Lidong Bing,\\nDeli Zhao, Anh Tuan Luu, and Yu Rong.

For the exact value, use direct multiplication:\\n38,697,082 × 4,133,991 = 160,000,000,000,000\\n(adjusted for precision)\\nFinal Answer: 160,000,000,000,000\\n(Note: The exact value requires precise arithmetic, but this is the closest simplified result using\\nscientific notation.)\\nInstance 7: Word problem by Kimi k1.5 (Method 1: DT = 1)\\nI need to find out how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking, and\\nthen calculate how much money she makes by selling the remaining eggs.\\nFirst, I subtract the eggs used for breakfast and muffins from the total eggs laid: - Total eggs laid:\\n8,488,302 - Eggs eaten for breakfast: 1,146,800 - Eggs used for muffins: 1,309,630\\nSo, the remaining eggs are:\\n8, 488, 302 −1, 146, 800 −1, 309, 630\\nLet me do the subtraction step by step: 1. Subtract the breakfast eggs:\\n8, 488, 302 −1, 146, 800 = 7, 341, 502\\n2. Subtract the muffin eggs:\\n7, 341, 502 −1, 309, 630 = 6, 031, 872\\nSo, Janet has 6,031,872 eggs left to sell.\\nNext, I calculate how much money she makes by selling these eggs at $7 each:\\n6, 031, 872 × 7\\nBreaking it down: - 6, 000, 000 × 7 = 42, 000, 000 - 31, 872 × 7 = 223, 104\\nAdding these together:\\n42, 000, 000 + 223, 104 = 42, 225, 104\\nSo, Janet makes 42225104 dollars every day at the farmers’ market.\\n17\\nPreprint.

Below is your previous thought.\\nAlright, so I need to add these two big numbers: 705,537,514,349,043 and 5,488,395,726,938. Hmm,\\nlet me see. Okay, first, adding large numbers can be a bit intimidating because there are so many\\ndigits, but if I take it step by step, it should be manageable...\\nSo the resulting number is:\\n7 1 1 0 2 5 7 1 0 0 7 5 9 8 1\\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check if that makes sense. Let’s break it down with commas:\\nStarting from the right, every three digits:\\n... 5981 →but let’s group the digits:\\n711,025,710,075,981?\\nWait, let’s see:\\nDigits:7 1 1 0 2 5 7 1 0 0 7 5 9 8 1\\nGrouping from the right:\\n15 digits: 7 1 1 0 2 5 7 1 0 0 7 5 9 8 1\\nStarting from the right, three by three:\\n981 (positions 13-15)\\n598 (positions 10-12): Wait, no. Let’s index them:\\n...\\nSo putting commas: 711,025,710,075,981\\nBut wait, the commas in large numbers go every three digits starting from the right, so it should\\nbe: 711,025,710,075,981\\nBut let’s verify the addition another way. Let’s convert the numbers to something more manage-\\nable...\\nBut when you have 1,025 billion, that’s 1 trillion and 25 billion. Similarly, 1,075 thousand is 1\\nmillion and 75 thousand.\\nSo adjusting:\\n710 trillion + 1 trillion = 711 trillion\\n25 billion + 909 million + 1 million = 25 billion + 910 million\\n75 thousand + 981 units = 75 thousand 981\\nSo the result would be 711,025,710,075,981\\nWhich matches the earlier result. Therefore, the sum is 711,025,710,075,981.\\nLet me check with another method. Let’s subtract a small number to see.\\nAlternatively, use approximate values to check. 705 trillion + 5 trillion is 710 trillion. But the actual\\nnumbers are slightly more: 705,537... +5,488... So roughly 705.5 +5.5 =711 trillion. The exact answer\\nis 711,025,710,075,981, which is about 711.025 trillion, which makes sense.\\nTherefore, I’m confident the answer is correct.\\n21\\nPreprint.

Logical reasoning is one of\\nthe most important and long-standing problems in\\nNLP (Hirschberg and Manning, 2015; Russell and\\nNorvig, 2010), and integrating this ability into nat-\\nural language understanding systems has always\\nbeen a goal pursued (Du et al., 2022).\\nNevertheless, scaling has been demonstrated\\nto offer limited advantages in resolving complex\\nlogical reasoning issues (Kazemi et al., 2022). For\\nexample, Saparov and He (2022) show that Chain-\\nof-Thought prompting struggles with proof planning\\nfor more complex logical reasoning problems. Addi-\\ntionally, the performance suffers greatly while han-\\ndling recently released and out-of-distribution logi-\\ncal reasoning datasets (Liu et al., 2023a). Despite\\nmany works have explored variants of Chain-of-\\nThought prompts to facilitate LLMs inference (Zelik-\\nman et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023), we discover\\nthat the present logical reasoning task prompts\\nplace an excessive amount of emphasis on the\\nreasoning process while ignoring the origin, pur-\\npose, and effectiveness of reasoning (Creswell\\net al., 2022; Xi et al., 2023). As examples shown in\\nQ1: Bob is green. True/false? \\nInput Facts: Alan is blue. Alan is \\nrough. Alan is young. Bob is big. \\nBob is round. Charlie is big. Charlie \\nis blue. Charlie is green. Dave is \\ngreen. Dave is rough.\\nInput Rules: Big people are rough. \\nIf someone is young and round then \\nthey are kind. If someone is round \\nand big then they are blue. All\\nrough people are green.\\nBob is big. \\nBig people are rough. \\nAll rough people are green.\\nAnswer: T\\nQ2: Dave is blue. True/false?\\nLess inspiring\\nFigure 1: Questions in RuleTaker involve logical\\nreasoning with facts and rules.\\nFigure 1, the difficulty in judging logical problems\\narises not only from the process of reasoning but\\nalso from the choice of facts and rules to use as a\\nstarting point. Even if we were provided the thought\\nprocess for some of the issues, it would not be very\\nbeneficial for others, based on how we previously\\ncreated the prompts.\\nIn this paper, we propose Hypothesis Testing\\nPrompting, a new and more considerate prompt\\ntemplate design idea. Hypothesis testing is a for-\\nmal procedure for investigating our ideas about\\nthe world using statistics and is often used by sci-\\nentists to test specific predictions (Bevans, 2022).\\nWe draw inspiration from its process to introduce a\\nprocess of conclusion assumptions, backward rea-\\nsoning, and fact verification. Experiments on Rule-\\nTaker (Clark et al., 2020) and ProofWriter (Tafjord\\net al., 2021) show the effectiveness of our novel\\nprompting paradigm as a strategy for promoting\\ndeductive reasoning in large language models. Fur-\\nther analyses show that Hypothesis Test prompting\\ngenerates more desirable intermediate processes\\narXiv:2405.06707v1  [cs.CL]  9 May 2024\\nand significantly improves the \"Unknown\" label.\\n2.\\nRelated Work\\n2.1.\\nFew-Shot Prompting\\nBrown et al. (2020) propose in-context learning as\\nan alternative few-shot prompting way to stimulate\\nability. Besides, chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al.,\\n2022b) is one of the most well-known works, which\\ndecomposes the problem into intermediate steps\\nand further improves the ability of large language\\nmodels. Subsequently, several follow-up works\\nwere carried out, including Zero-shot-CoT (simply\\nadding \"Let’s think step by step\" before each an-\\nswer) (Kojima et al., 2022), Self-consistency (Wang\\net al., 2022), complexity-based (Fu et al., 2022),\\nand other prompting work (Liu et al., 2023b; Jung\\net al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Saparov and He,\\n2022). While these methods enhance the perfor-\\nmance of inference by paying attention to indica-\\ntions of the reasoning process, they often overlook\\nsome aspects such as identifying the root cause of\\nthe problem, establishing efficient reasoning strate-\\ngies, and determining the direction of logical rea-\\nsoning.\\n2.2.\\nDeductive Reasoning\\nDeductive reasoning is defined as the applica-\\ntion of general concepts to particular circum-\\nstances (Johnson-Laird, 2010). Making logical as-\\nsumptions is the foundation of deductive reasoning,\\nwhich then bases a conclusion on those assump-\\ntions. The deduction task is then applied to a sit-\\nuation from the actual world after starting with a\\nrule. In light of the principles \"All men are mortal.\"\\nand \"Socrates is a man.\" for example, we can draw\\nthe conclusion that \"Socrates is mortal.\" (Johnson-\\nLaird, 1999).\\n3.\\nHypothesis Testing Prompting\\nHypothesis testing is a formal procedure for investi-\\ngating our ideas about the world using statistics and\\nused by scientists to test specific predictions that\\narise from theories (Bevans, 2022; La et al., 2012).\\nThere are 5 main steps in hypothesis testing:\\n1. State your research hypothesis;\\n2. Collect data in a way designed to test the hy-\\npothesis;\\n3. Perform an appropriate statistical test;\\n4. Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your\\nnull hypothesis;\\n5. Present the findings in your results and discus-\\nsion section;\\nWhen completing a challenging reasoning activ-\\nity, such as a multi-step deductive reasoning prob-\\nlem, one is not conducting random reasoning to\\nobtain all possible intermediate results. We shall\\nchoose the relevant conditions for inference ver-\\nification after initially making assumptions about\\nthe judgment problem, such as \" First assume the\\nconclusion is True and start from ... Then assume\\nthe conclusion is False and start from ... because\\nthe rules state that ... So the conclusion ...\". The\\npurpose of this study is to give language models\\nthe capacity to build a process that is similar to\\nwhat we defined as Hypothesis Testing Prompt-\\ning. We will show that large language models can\\ngenerate more appropriate thought and more ac-\\ncurate results if demonstrations of hypothesis test\\nprompting are provided in the exemplars for few-\\nshot prompting. Figure 2 shows an example of a\\nmodel producing a hypothesis testing thought to\\nsolve a deductive reasoning problem.\\n4.\\nExperiment\\n4.1.\\nExperimental Setup\\nWe explore Hypothesis Test Prompting for Chat-\\nGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo in the OpenAI API) on multiple\\nlogical reasoning benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. Considering FOL reasoning in\\nquestion answering systems, there are two world\\nassumptions (Reiter, 1981) that result in different\\nobjectives. One is the closed world assumption\\n(CWA), which is the presumption that what is not\\ncurrently known to be entailment is contradiction.\\nThe other is the open world assumption (OWA),\\nwhose objective should distinguish false proposi-\\ntions from uncertain ones. Due to differences in\\nworld assumptions, our analysis and solutions are\\nalso different.\\nWe consider the following two deductive reason-\\ning problem benchmarks: (1) the RuleTaker (Clark\\net al., 2020) benchmark using CWA assumption;\\n(2) the ProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2021) benchmark\\nusing OWA assumption. Both datasets are divided\\ninto five parts, each part requiring 0, ≤1, ≤2, ≤\\n3, and ≤5 hops of reasoning, respectively. We\\nconducted comparison tests on the test set of the\\ntwo datasets for 5 distinct hops.\\nStandard prompting. As one of the baselines,\\nwe take into account the common few-shot prompt-\\ning, made popular by Brown et al. (2020), in which\\na language model is provided with in-context ex-\\namples of input-output pairings before producing a\\nprediction for a test-time example. Examples are\\npresented in the form of questions and answers.\\nAs seen in Figure 2(above), the model directly an-\\nswers the question.\\nChain-of-Thought prompting.

Particularly, we highlight the Hypothesis testing reasoning processes. The comparative experi-\\nmental results show that: Hypothesis testing prompting enables large language models to tackle complex\\nlogical reasoning.\\npare with Chain-of-thought prompting which has\\nachieved encouraging results on complex reason-\\ning tasks (Wei et al., 2022b).\\nAs seen in Fig-\\nure 2(middle), the model not only provides the final\\nanswer but also comes with the consideration of\\nintermediate steps.\\nHypothesis Testing Prompting. Our proposed\\napproach is to augment each exemplars in few-shot\\nprompting with the thought of hypothesis testing for\\nan associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 2(be-\\nlow). We show one chain of thought exemplars\\n(Example: Judge the following conclusion ’<Con-\\nclusion>’ is true, false, or unknown, based on the\\nfollowing facts and rules: <Facts> ... <Rules> ...).\\n4.2.\\nExperimental Results\\nThe results for Hypothesis Testing Prompting and\\nthe baselines on the RuleTaker datasets are pro-\\nvided in Figure 3(a), and ProofWriter results are\\nshown in Figure 3(b). From the results, we ob-\\nserve that our method significantly outperforms the\\nother two baselines, especially on ProofWriter. Fig-\\nure 3(a) demonstrates that while CoT performs well\\nin the low hop, Hypothesis Testing prompting per-\\nforms better as the hops count increases on Rule-\\nTaker. While on ProofWriter, our approach has a\\nthorough lead (improved accuracy by over 4% on\\nall hops).

This\\nbeacuse the OWA hypothesis necessitates the ex-\\nclusion of both positive and negative findings to\\nvalidate the \"Unknown\" label. The advantages of\\nour strategy are illustrated by the comparison of the\\nmodel output outputs in Figure 2. The content \"First\\nassume the conclusion is True ... Then assume\\nthe conclusion is False ...

Five students are required to\\nmanually evaluate the outcomes of the intermediate\\nreasoning after we randomly picked 100 examples\\nfrom depth-5 of the ProofWriter. Proof accuracy rep-\\nresents the proportion where the inference process\\nhas been proven to be reasonable in the correct\\npart of data label prediction. We compare the re-\\nsults of Chian-of-Thought and Hypothesis Testing\\nprompting and report in Figure 4(a). While Hy-\\npothesis Testing prompting mostly produced the\\ncorrect intermediate reasoning process when the\\npredicted label was correct, CoT only generated\\nthe correct chain for 26% of the examples. This\\nresult is in line with other research showing that\\nLMs rely on spurious correlations when solving log-\\nical problems from beginning to end. Additionally,\\nour approach can successfully increase reason-\\ning’s rationality. In processing the \"Unknown\" label,\\nHypothesis Testing prompting performs noticeably\\nbetter than Chain-of-Thought.\\n\"Unknown\" accuracy.\\nIn the ProofWriter\\ndataset, we separately counted the accuracy of\\nthe \"Unknown\" label shown in Figure 4(b). The\\nresults point to a flaw in the Chain-of-Thought strat-\\negy’s handling of \"Unknown\" labels(only 0.3 accu-\\nracyies). Contrarily, Hypothesis Testing prompting\\nsignificantly increases the reliability of judging this\\nlabel (up to 0.65). This further illustrates the value\\nof holding various assumptions, as well as the re-\\nverse confirmation of conclusions.\\n5.\\nConclusion\\nWe have investigated Hypothesis Testing prompt-\\ning as a straightforward and widely applicable tech-\\nnique for improving deductive reasoning in large\\nlanguage models. Multiple assumptions are made\\nduring hypothesis testing, and conclusions are\\nreverse-validated to arrive at the one and only ac-\\ncurate answer. Through experiments on two logical\\nreasoning datasets, we find that Hypothesis Test-\\ning prompting allows large language models to con-\\nstruct reasoning more reasonably and accurately.\\nWe anticipate that additional research on language-\\nbased reasoning approaches will be stimulated by\\nour novel prompting design strategy.\\n6.\\nReferences\\nAlfred V.

      "  - **기존 연구와의 차이:** 기존에는 추론 구조(구성) 변화가 내용(결과) 변화보다 모델 성능에 더 큰 영향을 준다고 했으나, 본 연구는 마지막 결과 토큰의 미세 조작이 구조 변화보다 더 치명적임을 보임.\n",
